Hi there! I'm dust2ub(먼지) — someone who finds joy in making things, whether it’s a line of code, a piece of writing or drawing, or simply a curious idea brought to life. I love exploring the world through creation, learning, and quiet appreciation. This space is where I share little sparks of inspiration, toy projects, and the often fun, occasionally chaotic journey of turning imagination into something real.

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to have a look around!
